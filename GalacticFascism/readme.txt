Do you want to conquer the entire galaxy by using your massive fleet?
Or do you want to roleplay as a fascist in the galaxy? (e.g. CM)

This mod adds a fascist element in the Stellaris galaxy.
In the current version, it adds a fascist civic which allows total war from the beginning and has military buffs, but does not require the purification of heterogeneous POPs.
Just like the machine-intelligence assimilation machine, diplomacy itself is possible, albeit with a deteriorating attitude, and the POPs obtained by total war can be used.
Besides, several civics regarding with fascism are added.
Compared to the existing vanilla national policies, it will be easier for your empire to conquer and establish hegemony over all the different races in the galaxy. Some of the civics can also be used to make the fanatic purifier even more exciting. The setting is more for RP and exhilaration than balance.

Additional civics:
Fascist: All-out warfare is possible from the start, with half the military buff of Puritanism. Easy to wage a war of annexation because of the reduction of empire size effects. Hated by other countries and at the same time hates different races, but conversely good with countries with a national policy of fascist regime (hereafter referred to as "fascists"). It is in violent conflict with the burden-sharing empire.

Winged regime: a monarchical authoritarian version of a fascist regime. In addition to total war, it can use its own vassal state (gaining space military allowances), but the military buffs are weaker than those of the fascists, and while it is hated by other countries as much as the fascists, it only has a +/- 0 diplomatic compensation from the fascists. It can also be used for acceptance, so it is available for those who want to create a co-prosperity zone as it was built.

Corporatism: the original source of fascism. The result of class cooperation is various domestic policy buffs and further reduction of empire size at the expense of maintaining consumer goods. Can be used by material or authoritarian fascists.

Schwarze Sonne Erwacht: Esoteric na*i. Spartan lifestyle with low maintenance costs, which greatly reduces stability and happiness, but provides significant buffs related to livability, cohesion, and empire size. Diplomacy is not impossible, but hopeless. Even with fascists. Can be used by spiritual fascists or spiritual purists (dictatorship required).

Wages of Destruction: Buffs military and alloy production, and increases resources obtained from POPs during purification, but many other aspects of domestic politics (especially consumer goods production) are strongly debuffed. Resource production is added for a certain time from the start of the game, but when it is lost, the economic situation can easily become critical. Hints that there are strong buffs during the war, such as improved stability and a large suppression of empire scale effects, that POPs other than the first race are not fragilely productive, and that the speed of POP purification is slowing down. Can be used in fascist or military purificationism (dictatorship required) with militarism and exclusivity only.
