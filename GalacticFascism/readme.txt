Do you want to conquer the entire galaxy by using your massive fleet?
Or do you want to roleplay as a fascist in the galaxy? (e.g. CM)

This mod provides a fascist civic to realize the above property.
Like driven assimilator, an empire with our fascist civic can declare total war and use xeno pops from conquered colonies, whereas fanatic purifiers cannot use (they must purge xeno pops).
Comparing with conventional civics, this mod will reinforce your empire to establish hegemony.

Future property:
* Make other powerful civics for fascism or other axis powers like government.
* Modify other part such as policies, origins, technologies, and etc.
